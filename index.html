        <h2 class="homeText"><strong>Sharks.</strong> Their Importance and the Risk of Extinction.</h2>
        <p>For decades, sharks have been portrayed as villains of the sea. Since the release of Jaws in 1975, countless
            films have depicted great whites and other species as merciless man-eaters. In reality, however, humans are
            not part of a shark’s natural diet.</p>
        <p>There are over <strong>465 known species</strong> of sharks, ranging from the whale shark—which feeds
            primarily on plankton—to
            powerful predators like the great white. Most sharks feed on fish, crustaceans, mollusks, krill, marine
            mammals, and occasionally other sharks. Their role at the top of the food chain helps regulate marine
            ecosystems, keeping populations of prey species in balance.</p>
        <p>While sharks are formidable hunters, they are not out to devour humans. Sharks are naturally curious: when
            they approach you, it’s often to investigate rather than to attack. In many recorded “shark bites,” a shark
            takes a quick exploratory nip—and upon realizing you’re not its usual prey—immediately retreats. True, shark
            bites can be dangerous, but fatal attacks on humans are extremely rare.
        </p>
        <p>If you ever find yourself sharing the water with a shark, consider these safety tips:</p>
        <div id="safetyTips">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stay low in the water.</strong> Sharks often mistake silhouettes at the surface for seals or
                    other marine mammals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Avoid erratic movements.</strong> Smooth, steady motions reduce curiosity-driven approaches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Don’t provoke.</strong> Never corner or harass a shark; give it space to swim away.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Despite their critical ecological role, shark populations worldwide are in decline. Two major threats are:
        </p>
        <p>
        <div id="majorThreats">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overfishing for fins.</strong> Millions of sharks are caught each year, their fins removed,
                    and
                    bodies discarded
                    at sea.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>By-catch and habitat degradation.</strong> Sharks get unintentionally trapped in fishing
                    gear,
                    and pollution
                    further poisons their environment.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        </p>
        <p>Protecting sharks benefits the entire ocean. As apex predators, they help clear dead or weak marine life,
            contributing to healthier reefs and fisheries. They’re also valuable to science—research into shark immune
            systems has led to advances in cancer therapy and tissue regeneration.</p>
